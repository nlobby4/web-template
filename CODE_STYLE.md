Creating a code style guide in a `.md` (Markdown) file is a great way to document the coding standards for your team or project. A well-structured style guide can help ensure consistency across the codebase, especially in larger teams. Below is a general template you can follow to create your own code style guide.

### Sample Code Style Guide in Markdown (`CODE_STYLE.md`)

# Code Style Guide

This guide defines the coding conventions for this project. Adhering to these conventions will help ensure consistency and readability across the codebase.

## General Principles

- **Readability first**: The code should be easy to read and understand. Avoid complex logic when simpler solutions exist.
- **Consistency**: Follow the conventions defined here consistently across the project.
- **Code review**: Every pull request (PR) should be reviewed by at least one other developer.

## File and Folder Structure

- All source files should be placed in the `src/` folder.
- Use clear and descriptive folder names.
- Group files by feature or functionality.
- Example project structure:

    ```
    ├── src/
    │   ├── components/
    │   ├── utils/
    │   ├── services/
    │   └── app.js
    ├── test/
    └── README.md
    ```

## Naming Conventions

### Variables

- Use **camelCase** for variables and functions.
  ```javascript
  let userName = "Alice";
  ```

### Constants

- Use **UPPER_SNAKE_CASE** for constants.
  ```javascript
  const MAX_USERS = 100;
  ```

### Classes

- Use **PascalCase** for class names.
  ```javascript
  class UserProfile { ... }
  ```

### Files

- Use lowercase and hyphens for file names (`kebab-case`).
  ```bash
  user-profile.js
  ```

## Code Formatting

- **Indentation**: Use **2 spaces** per indentation level. Avoid tabs.
- **Line Length**: Limit lines to **80 characters**.
- **Semicolons**: Always use semicolons at the end of statements.
- **Braces**: Always use braces for control structures, even for single-line blocks.

  ```javascript
  if (condition) {
    doSomething();
  }
  ```

- **Whitespace**: Add a blank line before functions and methods, and between logical blocks of code.

## Variables and Constants

- Always use descriptive names for variables and constants.
- Avoid abbreviations unless they are widely understood.

  ```javascript
  // Bad
  let t = 10;

  // Good
  let timeoutDuration = 10;
  ```

## Functions and Methods

- Functions should do one thing and do it well.
- Function names should be descriptive and use verbs.
- Use arrow functions for simple function expressions.

  ```javascript
  // Bad
  function doStuff() { ... }

  // Good
  function calculateTotal() { ... }
  ```

  ```javascript
  // Good
  const getUserInfo = () => { ... };
  ```

- Always include a return type when the function returns a value.

## Comments and Documentation

- Write **clear** and **concise** comments explaining why something is done, not what is done.
- Use JSDoc for documenting functions.

  ```javascript
  /**
   * Calculate the total price of items.
   * @param {number} price - The price of a single item.
   * @param {number} quantity - The number of items.
   * @returns {number} The total price.
   */
  function calculateTotal(price, quantity) {
    return price * quantity;
  }
  ```

- Use **TODO** and **FIXME** to highlight unfinished or problematic code.

  ```javascript
  // TODO: Add error handling
  ```

## Error Handling

- Always handle errors using try-catch blocks when necessary.
- Avoid using `console.log` for error handling in production code.
- Use **custom error classes** when dealing with specific types of errors.

  ```javascript
  class NotFoundError extends Error {
    constructor(message) {
      super(message);
      this.name = "NotFoundError";
    }
  }

  throw new NotFoundError("Item not found.");
  ```

## Dependencies and Imports

- Organize imports as follows:
  1. Built-in modules (e.g., `fs`, `path`)
  2. External dependencies (e.g., `lodash`, `axios`)
  3. Internal modules (e.g., `./utils`, `./models`)
- Always use **named imports** where possible.

  ```javascript
  import { formatDate } from 'utils';
  ```

- **No unused imports**: Remove any imports that are not used in the file.

## Testing

- All code should be unit tested.
- Follow the naming convention `*_test.js` for test files.
- Use **descriptive** test names that explain what is being tested.

  ```javascript
  test('calculateTotal should return the correct total', () => {
    expect(calculateTotal(10, 2)).toBe(20);
  });
  ```

- Always mock external services or APIs in tests.

**Note**: This style guide is subject to change as the project evolves. Ensure to check for updates and new conventions.

### How to Customize

1. **Section Specificity**: You can add or remove sections based on the needs of your team or project. For example, if you're working with a JavaScript-based project, you may want to add sections for `ESLint` rules or specific libraries you're using (like React or Express).
2. **Add Links to External Resources**: You can link to external resources, such as code style guides for specific technologies (e.g., [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript)), for more detailed information.
3. **Examples**: Provide code examples for each guideline to make them clearer and more actionable.
4. **Format**: Markdown allows you to format text easily, use bullet points, numbered lists, and code blocks to make the document more readable.

This style guide can be checked in your repository and updated as needed to ensure that the team follows the same conventions for consistency and readability.
